This Python script is designed to extract email addresses from HTML content obtained from a list of URLs provided in a CSV file. It provides a simple and efficient way to scrape email addresses from web pages for various purposes such as data collection, contact information retrieval, or analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- The following Python modules:
  - `urllib.request` for making HTTP requests.
  - `re` for regular expression pattern matching.
  - `csv` for reading the URLs from a CSV file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a CSV file containing the URLs you want to scrape. Each URL should be placed in the first column of the CSV file.
3. Open the script file (`email_scraper.py`) in a text editor of your choice.
4. Update the `csv_file_path` variable in the `main` function with the path to your CSV file.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
6. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python email_scraper.py
The script will start processing the URLs in the CSV file. For each URL, it will retrieve the HTML content, extract the email addresses using regular expressions, and print the results to the console.

Please note that the script handles connection errors gracefully by automatically retrying a few times with a delay between retries. If an error persists, it will be displayed on the console.

Customization
Retry Behavior: You can adjust the number of retries and the delay between retries in case of connection errors. Modify the retries and delay parameters in the get_html function to suit your needs.
Email Extraction: The script uses a regular expression pattern to identify and extract email addresses from the HTML content. If you want to change the regular expression pattern, you can modify the extract_email_addresses function. Be cautious and ensure your pattern adheres to the email address structure to avoid false positives or exclusions.
